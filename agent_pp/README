AGENT++ V4.x README
===================

This library requires SNMP++v3.3 or later which can be obtained from
http://www.agentpp.com. SNMP++ up to 2.8 was designed by Peter Mellquist
(Hewlett Packard Co.) and was available from
http://rosegarden.external.hp.com/snmp++. This link no longer works
because HP discontinued SNMP++. You can download the patched version 2.8a
still from http://www.agentpp.com/snmp++v2.8a.tar.gz.

====================================================================

USAGE:

Note: If you are using autoconf, you can set the following as parameters
to the configure script.

For cmake you need to set the root directory of your SNMP++ installation
when running cmake like this:

cmake -D -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl \
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=agentpp-libs -DSNMP_PP_ROOT_DIR=/home/agentpp/snmp++

The AGENT++ lib (libagent++.[so|a]) should be compiled with 

-D_THREADS 

to enable the use of pthreads (multi-threading). This flag is defined
in agent++/include/agent++.h. You can undef it in order to build
a single threaded agent. Always include agent++.h in all your
source files to make sure that the lib and your code use the same
settings.

You only need to include "mib.h" to use the basic features of
AGENT++. If you want to use the logging mechanism of AGENT++ you have
to include "log.h" additionally. You can set the filter of the default
log by

	DefaultLog::log->set_filter(<logname>_LOG_IND, <level>);

and disable the logging at all by using the compiler switch -D_NO_LOGGING
which is recommended for best agent performance.
