README autoconf
===============

To use autoconf 2.64 or later with AGENT++, execute the following 
commands in the "agent++" directory:

autoreconf -i
./configure
make

If "autoreconf" fails or prints warnings about newer *.m4 files
you may try to update the provided m4 scripts in the build-aux 
directory with:

autoreconf -i --force

The autoreconf process needs at least the following tools/libs:

autoconf
libtoolize
pkgconfig
openssl-devel | libdes | libtomcrypt  (required for SNMPv3 support)


The Makfile.<os-name> and common.mk files are no longer 
maintained but provided for reference for a minimal setup 
to ease porting AGENT++ to other platforms.

Redhat/Centos
-------------
On Redhat/Centos (7.x or later) the libraries are searched in 'lib64' 
instead of 'lib' on 64bit machines. If you are using the --prefix option 
of 'configure' you might need to create a symlink "ln -s lib lib64" in the
directory defined by "--prefix=<dir>" to be able to compile dependent
libraries with the '--with-libsnnp-prefix' or '--with-libagentpp-prefix' 
options.
