AGENPRO TEMPLATES
=================

To setup your own build environment for an AgenPro generated (simulation)
agent:

1. Generate the source files into the agenpro/agent/src directory and the header
files into the agenpro/agent/include directory using AgenPro. 

2. Build the agent. Run in the agent++ directory:
./configure --with-agenpro
make

To enable persistent storage for an agent, create an empty folder
"config" in the "src" directory of your agent, for example:

mkdir agent++/agenpro/agent/src/config
